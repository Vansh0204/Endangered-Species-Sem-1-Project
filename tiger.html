            <h2>About Bengal Tigers</h2>
            <p>The Royal Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris) is the largest species of big cat, native to parts of Asia. Known for their striking orange fur with black stripes, Bengal tigers are solitary animals that roam dense forests, grasslands, and wetlands</p>
            <p>Bengal tigers typically inhabit grasslands, tropical forests, and mangrove swamps. They are primarily found in national parks and wildlife sanctuaries where their habitats are protected.</p> 
            <p>Tigers play a crucial role in maintaining ecological balance as top predators, controlling prey populations, and ensuring the health of their ecosystems.</p>

            <h2>Threats to Tigers</h2>
            <p>Tigers face numerous threats to their survival, including habitat loss, poaching for their fur and bones, and human-wildlife conflict. These factors have contributed to the decline of tiger populations worldwide.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Habitat destruction and fragmentation</li>
                <li>Poaching for illegal wildlife trade</li>
                <li>Loss of prey species</li>
                <li>Human-wildlife conflict</li>

            <h2>Conservation Efforts</h2>
            <p>Several organizations and governments are working to protect tigers through habitat restoration, anti-poaching initiatives, and public awareness campaigns. Some key conservation efforts include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Establishing protected areas and tiger reserves</li>
                <li>Supporting anti-poaching patrols and law enforcement</li>
                <li>Educating local communities on wildlife conservation</li>
                <li>Breeding programs and reintroductions into the wild</li>

            <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Bengal tigers are the largest subspecies of tiger.</li>
                <li>They are solitary animals, except during mating season or when a mother is with her cubs.</li>
                <li>Each tiger's stripes are unique, like human fingerprints.</li>

                <p>The map showcases the distribution of tiger reserves, forests, and tiger sampling locations across India. Tiger reserves (dark green) and areas of tiger presence (light green) are concentrated in key regions such as the north (e.g., Corbett, Ranthambore), central (e.g., Kanha, Bandhavgarh), south (e.g., Nagarhole, Bandipur), and northeast (e.g., Kaziranga, Sunderbans). Sampling locations (purple dots) indicate areas where data on tiger populations have been collected, with notable hotspots including Wayanad, Kanha, and Ranthambore. This highlights India's extensive efforts to monitor and conserve its tiger population across diverse habitats.</p>
