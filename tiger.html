            <h2>About Tigers</h2>
            <p>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest species of big cat, native to parts of Asia. Known for their striking orange fur with black stripes, tigers are solitary animals that roam dense forests, grasslands, and wetlands.</p>
            <p>There are several subspecies of tigers, including the Bengal tiger, Siberian tiger, and Sumatran tiger, each adapted to different environments. Unfortunately, all tiger subspecies are under threat due to habitat destruction, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict, making their conservation a global priority. They are listed as endangered, with wild populations declining rapidly.</p> 
            <p>Tigers play a crucial role in maintaining ecological balance as top predators, controlling prey populations, and ensuring the health of their ecosystems.</p>
