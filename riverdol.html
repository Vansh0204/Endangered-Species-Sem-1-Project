            <h2>About River Dolphins</h2>
            <p>The river dolphin (family Platanistidae) is a freshwater dolphin species found in the rivers and lakes of Asia and South America. Known for their long, beak-like snouts and adaptability to river ecosystems, these dolphins have evolved to live in complex, murky waters.</p>
            <p>There are five known species of river dolphins: the Amazon river dolphin, the Ganges river dolphin, the Indus river dolphin, the Yangtze river dolphin (now possibly extinct), and the Baiji. Each species is adapted to its specific environment, with differences in physical characteristics and behaviors.</p>
            <p>River dolphins are integral to the health of freshwater ecosystems, playing important roles in maintaining the balance of river habitats. However, many species face critical threats that put their survival in jeopardy.</p>

            <h2>Threats to River Dolphins</h2>
            <p>River dolphins are facing a number of threats that contribute to their endangered status, such as habitat loss, pollution, and human activity. These threats continue to reduce their populations and disrupt their natural habitats.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Habitat destruction due to damming and river infrastructure projects</li>
                <li>Pollution, particularly plastic and chemical waste in rivers</li>
                <li>Fishing nets and bycatch incidents</li>
                <li>Development and agriculture have had devastating impacts on the habitats on river dolphins.</li>
